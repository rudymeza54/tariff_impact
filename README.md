# Tariff Impact Analysis - ETL Project

This project is an **ETL pipeline and API dashboard** designed to analyze the impact of tariffs on historical market data. The application is built with **Flask**, utilizes **PostgreSQL** for data storage, processes data with **Python scripts**, and presents insights via a **D3.js front-end dashboard**.

---

## Summary

The **Tariff Impact Analysis Dashboard** provides an interactive visualization of how tariffs affect agriculture and lumber markets. It includes:

- A **Flask-based REST API** to serve tariff impact data.
- **Python scripts** for fetching and processing market data and tariff events.
- A **PostgreSQL database** to store processed data.
- An interactive **D3.js dashboard** for visualizing insights.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following interactive features:

- **Controls**:
  - Select specific tariff events.
  - Choose sectors (e.g., Lumber Companies, Lumber ETFs, Agriculture Companies).
  - Adjust the time window (Â±10, Â±20, Â±30 days) to update the dashboard.

- **Event Information**:
  - Detailed descriptions of tariff events, including dates, affected sectors, and comprehensive descriptions.

- **Impact Summary**:
  - Displays the overall effect of the selected tariff event.
  - Highlights the average sector impact, most affected, and least affected entities.

- **Price Trends**:
  - Visual representation of price movements over time in relation to the tariff event.

- **Differential Impact**:
  - Analysis of how different sectors or companies are variably affected by the tariff.

- **Trading Volume**:
  - Insights into changes in trading volumes pre- and post-tariff implementation.

- **Sector Heatmap**:
  - A heatmap illustrating the intensity of the tariff's impact across various sectors.
